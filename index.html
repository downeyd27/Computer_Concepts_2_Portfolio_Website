                <h2>Background</h2>

                <p>
                    I grew up in a small Danish town called Solvang -- it's worth a google if you haven't heard of it. From there I found my way in San Francisco's North Bay where I went to Sonoma State University. In the midst of my education I took a job as a store manager for GNC (General Nutrition Center) where I worked for a few years before deciding to change careers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After deciding to change careers to software / web development, I completed a few online courses from Santa Rosa Junior College and then made my way to Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco. My wife and I didn't see our selves living the Silicon Valley life style so we decided to move North and continue to work towards a degree in CIS.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I currently enjoy volunteering at Free Geek in SE Portland in my spare time to try and gain useful skills while giving back to the community and I hope to make my way into the Portland Tech scene as soon as possible while continuing my education at PCC.
